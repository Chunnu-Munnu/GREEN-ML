Green ML Compression Suite üå±
An open-source toolkit to make AI models lighter, faster, and more sustainable. Our mission is to democratize AI by making it efficient enough to run anywhere, for everyone.

The Problem: AI's Growing Carbon Footprint
Artificial Intelligence is a revolutionary technology, but it has a hidden cost. The current trend of building ever-larger models has led to an unsustainable demand for computational resources.

Massive Energy Consumption: Training a single large model can emit over 550 tons of CO‚ÇÇ.

High Operational Costs: Inference (daily usage) accounts for up to 90% of an AI model's lifetime energy costs, requiring vast, 24/7 data centers.

A Barrier to Innovation: The need for expensive hardware (often ‚Çπ25,00,000+ for a single high-end GPU) locks out innovators in startups, academia, and emerging markets like India.

Our Solution: A Toolkit for Sustainable AI
The Green ML Compression Suite is a practical, powerful, and easy-to-use Python library that directly tackles this problem. It provides an integrated pipeline to transform bloated, inefficient models into lean, green, and deployable assets.

Core Features
‚úÖ Intelligent Pruning: Systematically removes redundant model components to reduce size and computation.

‚úÖ Advanced Quantization: Converts models to efficient 8-bit integer formats with minimal accuracy loss using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT).

‚úÖ The "Green Report Card": A unique feature that generates a clear report quantifying the improvements in model size, prediction speed, and estimated energy savings.

üöÄ Getting Started
Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/GreenML-Suite/Core-Optimizer.git](https://github.com/GreenML-Suite/Core-Optimizer.git)
cd Core-Optimizer

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Quickstart: Optimize Your First Model
Optimizing a model is designed to be simple. Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to take a standard PyTorch CNN model and make it "Green."

import torch
from torchvision.models import resnet18
from greenml.suite import GreenMLSuite
from greenml.reporter import report_model

# 1. Load your pre-trained model
model = resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

# 2. Profile the baseline model
print("--- Baseline Model ---")
report_model(model, input_shape=(1, 3, 224, 224))

# 3. Initialize the Green ML Suite with an optimization strategy
suite = GreenMLSuite(strategy=['prune', 'quantize'])

# 4. Run the optimization pipeline
# (Note: This would require a dataloader for retraining steps)
# green_model = suite.optimize(model, train_dataloader) 
# For this example, we'll use a placeholder for the optimized model
green_model = suite.quantize(suite.prune(model, amount=0.5)) # Simplified example

# 5. Report on the final, optimized model
print("\n--- Green Model ---")
report_model(green_model, input_shape=(1, 3, 224, 224))

üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap
This project is actively developed. Our goal is to build the most comprehensive and user-friendly toolkit for sustainable AI.

[x] Core Pipeline: Pruning and Post-Training Quantization.

[ ] Advanced QAT: Implement full Quantization-Aware Training.

[ ] Knowledge Distillation: Add support for training smaller "student" models.

[ ] NLP Model Support: Create specialized pipelines for Transformers (e.g., BERT, T5).

[ ] Expanded "Green Report Card": Include estimated CO‚ÇÇ and cloud cost savings.
